# King County Realty - Increasing Revenue From Seller Commisions

**Authors**:[Russell Pihlstrom](mailto:rgpihlstrom@yahoo.com)

## Overview

This project analyzes the best route for Microsoft to break into the film industry. Descriptive analysis of studios show the top companies to produce your film by genre. Analyzing cast shows how many “A Players” your movie should have & analysis of reviews will show you the importance of critics including which ones to choose. This will give Microsoft the tools to make films more likely to be successful. 


## Business Problem

The king County Realty company is looking to increase the number of new customers it helps in selling their homes on a monthly basis.  The Cheif Marketing Officer believes it has an opportunity to build consumers awareness with potential buyers and sellers.  Its awareness buidling strategy has mutiple tactics but all messaging drives consumers either to the corporate customer service line or the company website.  The corporate website is robust but the Marketing Team believes it needs a web-based tool that can auto-generated a homes sale price simply by allowing a user to entered an address or parcel number.  After recieving a quote from the newly develeped tool the system will invite the user to enter their contact information to receive a more refined quote based on any additional provided information.  Ultimately this will result in additional cutomer touchpoints and additional opportunities to establish new customers.

## Methods

 This project uses descriptive analysis, with description of trends over time. This provides the opportunity to analyze the movie industry in a manner that shows relationships between factors including: Sales, Profitability, Costs, Genre, People, Studio, Critics, and more. Our data was collected and summarized primarily through downloading, scraping, cleaning & linking via provided or
created keys.


## Results

The most profitable genres are Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Animation.

![Movie_Genres](/images/Movie_Genre.png)


The most profitable Action and Adventure movies contain between three and seven  “A Players,” thus demonstrating the strong correlation between “A Player” presence, and profitability. Many of the most profitable films in the other genres have no more than two “A Players” and therefore, do not require these figures to make a profitable film.

Regardless of whether or not the popularity was a dislike or a like by either critics or audience, the greater the popularity, the greater the return on investment. Films that had fewer interactions had a lower return on investment.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for maximizing your next movie’s profitability:

- **Make a movie with elements of adventure, sci-fi, and animation.**  The most profitable film genres in the past 15 years are the above recommended genres. While some other films might have greater return on investment, the overall profits are highest with these three.
- **If pursuing an Adventure film, ensure your movie has at least three “A Players.”** The Bankability Index® shows that by including at least three high-profile actors, directors, producers, or screenwriters, your film is guaranteed to make a certain baseline revenue.
- **eFilmCritic.com, TimeOut, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Entertainment Weekly are our five recommended film critic publications.**  Sending your film to them pre-release will benefit your movie’s profitability because they 1) post the largest number of reviews 2) are popular enough to be read by a wide audience 3) have a high positivity rate, making it more probable to receive a positive review.

### Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights to substantiate future profit in the film industry.

- **Rightsize your budget and maximize return.** If you are working on a tighter budget, we can tailor your genre inquiry to identify the highest return on investment with your specific budget.
- **Model need for franchising.** We are able to further model the Bankability Index to parlay your next box office-busting movie into the next hit-franchise.
- **Predicting your next awards.** Given your genre choice, we can model critic success by genre and forecast your chances of winning film awards.
